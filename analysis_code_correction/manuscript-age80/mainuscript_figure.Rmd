In fully adjusted models, additional adjustments included measured waist-to-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, reported smoking status, level of education attainment, and presence of diabetes at baseline (diagnosed, treated or HbA1c >6.5%). Analyses were restricted to eligible participants with complete data on all covariates (see footnote of Table 1 for details).. "}

The odds ratio (on log scale) for each of the five quintiles of the eight selected PRSs are plotted against their respective mean PRS in each quintile. The 95% confidence intervals estimated by floating absolute risk are presented as vertical error bars through each point. The size of each estimate point is inversely proportional to their respective standard error. The ORs and the number of CAD cases within each quintile are displayed above and below the corresponding error bar. "}
